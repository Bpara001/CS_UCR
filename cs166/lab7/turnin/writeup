1. How much faster does queries.sql run when your indexes are in 
place as compared to having no indexes?
->Interestingly, my queries run faster without my indexes. perphas it has something to do with indexing everything?

2. How much longer do the update statements take with the indexes 
in place compared to having no indexes? Quantify the difference.
->with my tests, the update statements took only a little longer compared to having no indexes. the differences were very minor, less than a 1% difference, averaged over 10 tests.

3. What happens if you create your indexes before you load the data 
in the two big tables?
->the time to run my queries.sql takes much longer than creating my indexes before I load the big data tables, twice as long on average

4. Are there any select statements which can't be helped by indexes?
->no.
