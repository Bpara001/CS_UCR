Assignment: Lab #3


I. Lab objective
The goal of this lab was to design an assembler
to compile MIPS assembly code into machine language.

II . Personal contributions
Chris wrote a large portion of the assembler, since
he designed the integer to binary converter function
on his own time, while Hans focused on writing the VHDL.
We worked together to debug both programs

III. Skill learned & knowledge gained
The assembler logic was fairly easy to write, but the VHDL was very
confusing at first.  We eventually made sense of the logic
and were able to get most of the components connected and implemented.

IV. Known bug locations
Most of our fields get valid values, and the datapaths should be
connected correctly.  However, our PC does not work properly 
and cannot be initialized nor will it increment since the value is
null.  We were also unable to initialize our register values, 
and since we did not implement any functions to set imediate values we could
never properly access the registers to do arithmetic.  The assembler
should work flawlessly to produce a correct COE file.  The
branch and decrement operation is also not implemented in the
VHDL.

V. Feedback on the lab
The VHDL portion was very confusing, especially because there were 
multiple parts where certain components did not have the correct syntax,
plaguing the program with obscure bugs.  This often made it hard to tell
which of the given components was actually completely correct or not.
However, since the bugs were present, we were essentially forced to
understand the code in order to be able to fix it, so in the end it was
actually beneficial because we learned how all the component files 
worked and how to create entities.
