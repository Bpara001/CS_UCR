I. Lab objective
The lab objective was to introduce us to using Xilinx ISE 13 tool-chain.
To do this we designed a basic ALU.

II . Personal contributions
Hans wrote most of the processes for the ALU, while Chris modified the testbench to test
more cases as well as debugged the program when the program output the wrong values
for the new test cases.  

III. Skill learned & knowledge gained.
We learned basics of coding in VHDL, specifically regarding syntax and semantics.
It was very different coding in a hardware mindset, since all processes work in parallel.
However, over the course of the first lab, we had many questions answered and 
now have a better understanding of how to code in VHDL.


IV. Known bugs locations
We tested our design with numerous cases, supplementing what was already
provided in the test bench template. There may have been a few cases that we missed,
and therefore our program might possibly fail still for specific input.
The largest bug we had was regarding our testbench not inheriting the correct
component, resulting in our outputs always being uninitialized.  Definitely a lesson
learned.

V. Feedback on the lab
Overall the lab was great!
