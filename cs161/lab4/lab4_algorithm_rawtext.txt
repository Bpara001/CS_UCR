Anywhere with “//” denotes the remainder of the line is a comment
Define “/” as logical OR
Define “F” as Fetch
Define “D” as decode
Define “X” as execute
Define “M” as  MEM
Define “W” as  Write Back
Define “O” as output
Define “LA” as Latch F/D
Define “LB” as Latch D/X
Define “LC” as Latch X/M
Define “LD” as Latch M/W
Define “LE” as Latch W/O

Define “D1” as 1st previous instruction register destination
Define “D2” as 2nd previous instruction register destination
Define “D3” as 3rd previous instruction register destination
Define “D4” as 4th previous instruction register destination

Define “O1” as 1st previous instruction opcode
Define “O2” as 2nd previous instruction opcode
Define “O3” as 3rd previous instruction opcode
Define “O4” as 4th pervious instruction opcode

Define “S1” as a stall signal for all stages behind LA
Define “S2” as a stall signal for all stages behind LB
Define “S3” as a stall signal for all stages behind LC
Define “S4” as a stall signal for all stages behind LD
Define “S5” as a stall signal for all stages behind LE

Define “D0” as current instruction register destination taken from LB
Define “O0” as current instruction opcode taken from LB
Define “B-type” as branch subset of I-type
Define ‘-’ as stall
Define highlighted colors like  X,M,W  as a way to represent forwarding.

//SETTING UP SOURCE REGISTERS when applicable
If D0 is equal to R-type OR D0 is equal to B-type,
then do the following:
       	Define “Rs” as current source1 register taken from LB
Define “Rt” as current source2 register taken from LB
If D0 is an I-Type instruction,
then do the following:
       	Define “Rs” as current source1 register taken from LB


//LOGIC FOR FORWARDING
Forward to ID/EX when:
	
*RT or RS is the same as D1		
	<LC | LB>  forward stage LC in the to stage LB of D0

*RT or RS is the same as D2 and when O1 is a R-type or I-Type excluding B-Types
		<LD | LB> forward stage D od D2 in the to stage B of D0		


*RT or RS is the same as D1 and when corresponding opcode is a LW
		<LD | LB> forward stage D of D1 to stage B of D0		

Forward to EX/MEM when:
	* RT or RS are the same as D1 and when O1 is LW and when O0 is SW
		<LD | LC> forward stage D of D1 to stage B of D0
			
//LOGIC FOR STALLING
Stall when one of the following occurs:

       	*RT or RS are the same as D1/D2/ D3/ D4 and when corresponding the opcode for LW
       	 	Stall; set S3 to 1, and set S1,S2,S4,S5 to 0
       		

	*D1/D2/D3/D4 ‘s corresponding opcode is  a B-type instruction OR a J-type
                 Stall: S0,S1,S2,S4,S5 to 0



//Logic for taking a new instruction every cycle updating Di’s and Oi’s
D4 is assigned as the value from D3
D3 is assigned as the value from D2
D2 is assigned as the value from D1
D1 is assigned as the value from D0
O4 is assigned as the value from O3
O3 is assigned as the value from O2
O2 is assigned as the value from O1
O1 is assigned as the value from O0
