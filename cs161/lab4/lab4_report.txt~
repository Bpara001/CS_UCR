I. Lab objective
	The objective of this lab was to implement control and data hazard detection in MIPS pipeline. 

II . Personal contributions:
	We both worked on designing the algorithm(s) and logic that is used for completing the objective. We also both worked on making example to help us valid the algorithm(s) and logic.

III. Skill learned & knowledge gained.
	This lab helped reinforce the knowledge that we gained about pipelines, control and data hazard detection.

IV. Known bugs locations
	None as of the time this document was submitted.

V. Feedback on the lab
	The lab at first seemed a little confusing. After reading the lab manual more in depth,, talking with the TA ,re-reading lecture slides and the book the lab became more clear.
