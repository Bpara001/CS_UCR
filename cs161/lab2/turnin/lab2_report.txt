Assignment: Lab #2
I acknowledge all content is original.

I. Lab objective
The objective of this lab is to become familiar with fixed and floating point
representations of numbers. It also included becoming more familiar with
MIPS and VHDL. 

II . Personal contributions
Both me and my partner worked on both parts of the code.In both parts of the
assignment, both of us wrote down on paper how to convert fixed to floating
and floating to fixed to create an algorithm.  

III. Skill learned & knowledge gained.
Overall me and my partner learned about new functions in VHDL such as 
conv_int. Also we learned how to use MIPS (opcodes and what they do)
and it refreshed us on how assembly code works.

IV. Known bugs locations
For each test case, you must wait 20 seconds between each test case for the
output to show up properly.  Also for the MIPS part, we could not get it to
work for negative test cases.

V. Feedback on the lab
This lab was helpful in becoming familiar with VHDL and MIPS. We learned
about various new data types and functions in VHDL.
