Lab Objective
    The objective of this lab was to familiarize us with the addition of
Binary Coded Decimals and conversion of the Densely Packed Decimal to the 
Binary Coded Decimal.


Personal Contributions
	 Allen - 50%. Chris - 50%. We both contributed to an equal amount of
work in this lab. We worked on one program together and explained to eachother
how the lab assignment should work. 


Skill Learned & Knowledge Gained
      We learned to code in VHDL a lot better than before. We learned how
the addition of Binary Coded Decimals worked with full adders. We learned how
to convert from DPDs to BCD in VHDL.


Known Bugs Location
      We had a  problem synthesizing in Xilinx where it said that we needed to
contact technical support. We figured out that it was our syntax or coding 
style that generated this error. We were initializing a signal inside a process
where it shouldn't be.


Feedback on the Lab
      Lab 5 was very straight forward. It was very easy to understand the
material since we went over it in the 161L lecture. There was no problem
completing this lab within the 3 hour lab time.
