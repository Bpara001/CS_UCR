My program consists of 3 functions:execute,change_directory,and main
Design is based off Professor Payne's sample code from lab and notes.

-execute:
    functions the same as Professor Payne's "doit" function,
    creates a fork so execvp() doesnt kill the program
    supports operations running when checking for & chracter
    checks special characters and does i/o redirection
    allows the use of a basic pipe
    calls execvp to execute the user command
    prints errors based on strerror() if applicable

-change_directory:
    functions as the shell's cd command
    using the chdir function, it can change the current directory
    outputs my made error message if user inputs incorrect syntax

-main:
    clears the terminal and outputs introduction message
    inside a while loop, executes the user's inputs until exit is called
    calls execute and change_directory when needed
    populates a vector with strings before execute is called
    outputs end program string to indicate when program is terminated
