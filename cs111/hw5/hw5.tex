\begin{problem}
You are given two bipartite graphs $G$ and $H$ below. For each
graph determine whether it has a perfect matching.
Justify your answer, either by 
listing the edges that are in the matching or using
Hall's Theorem to show that the graph does not have a
perfect matching.

\begin{problem}
You are given two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ below. For each
graph determine whether it is planar or not.
Justify your answer, either by giving a planar embedding or using
Kuratowski's Theorem to show that the graph is not planar.
In either case, the solution should consist of an
appropriate drawing and a brief explanation.

\paragraph{Submission.}
You need to turn in your homework via ilearn no later than
Friday, June 3 at midnight. Pictures should be 
imported into {\LaTeX} in pdf (see the source file to see
how to do that). You can draw them in any drawing
software and export in pdf, or draw by hand and scan.
