\begin{problem}
We construct recursively binary trees $T_0, T_1, T_2, ...$,
as follows. Both $T_0$ and $T_1$ consist of a single node.
For $n\ge 2$, to obtain $T_n$, we link
one copy of $T_{n-1}$ and two copies of
$T_{n-2}$, as in the figure below:

\end{center}

Let $b_n$ be the number of nodes in $T_n$. For example,
$b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = 5$ and $b_3 = 9$. Give the
formula for $b_n$. Show your work.  The solution
must consist of the following steps:
(i) Set up a recurrence equation and give a brief justification.
(ii) Give the associated homogeneous equation.
(iii) Determine the characteristic equation and solve it.
(iv) Give the general solution for the homogeneous equation.
(v) Determine a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation.
(vi) Give the general solution for the non-homogeneous equation.
(vii) Use the initial conditions to compute the final answer.

\begin{problem}
Let $S_n$ be the number of tilings of the $n\times 3$ grid with
$1\times 3$ and $2\times 3$ tiles. (Tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees.)
 Give a recurrence relation
for $S_n$ and justify its correctness.

Note: This recurrence will be of degree higher than $2$, and you
\emph{do not} have to solve it. The reverse page shows all tilings of
the $5\times 3$ grid, showing that $S_5 = 23$. You can use this value to
verify you recurrence.

\begin{problem}
Solve the following recurrence equation:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
        V_n &=& 4V_{n-1} - 2V_{n-2}\\
        V_0 &=& 0 \\
        V_1 &=& 1
\end{eqnarray*}

Show your work.
